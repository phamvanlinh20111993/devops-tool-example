*) Vagrant boxes
Boxes are the package format for Vagrant environments. You specify a box environment and operating configurations in your Vagrantfile. 
You can use a box on any supported platform to bring up identical working environments. 
To enable teams to use and manage the same boxes, versions are supported.

*) Vagrantfile
The primary function of the Vagrantfile is to describe the type of machine required for a project, and how to configure and provision these machines. 
Vagrantfiles are called Vagrantfiles because the actual literal filename for the file is Vagrantfile (casing does not matter unless your file system is running in a strict case sensitive mode).

commands:

	set VAGRANT_PREFER_SYSTEM_BIN=0

    vagrant up --provision
	
	vagrant ssh --debug
	
	vagrant ssh <vm define name ex: ansibleHost>
	
	vagrant halt [name|id]
	  - This command shuts down the running machine Vagrant is managing.
		Vagrant will first attempt to gracefully shut down the machine by running the guest OS shutdown mechanism. 
		If this fails, or if the --force flag is specified, 
		Vagrant will effectively just shut off power to the machine.
	
	vagrant reload [name|id] --provision
	 - This command is usually required for changes made in the Vagrantfile to take effect. 
	   After making any modifications to the Vagrantfile, a reload should be called.
	
	vagrant global-status
	   - This command will tell you the state of all active Vagrant environments on the system for the currently logged in user.
	
	vagrant box list
	
	vagrant ssh-config [name|id]
		- This will output valid configuration for an SSH config file to SSH into the running 
		  Vagrant machine from ssh directly (instead of using vagrant ssh).
	
	vagrant destroy [name|id]
	   - This command stops the running machine Vagrant is managing and destroys all resources that were created during the machine creation process. 
	     After running this command, your computer should be left at a clean state, as if you never created the guest machine in the first place.
	
	ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -C "phamvanlinh20111993@gmail.com"
	
	vagrant box prune 
		- This command removes old versions of installed boxes. If the box is currently in use vagrant will ask for confirmation.
	
	vagrant box remove NAME
		- This command removes a box from Vagrant that matches the given name.
		- If a box has multiple providers, the exact provider must be specified with the --provider flag. If a box has multiple versions, you can select what versions to delete with the --box-version flag or remove all versions with the --all flag.
